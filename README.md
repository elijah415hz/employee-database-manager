## Description
Employee Tracker is a lightweight CLI that can be used to track employees for any company. It stores all of your departments, roles, managers, and employees in a MYSQL database and provides you with a full suite of tools to update and manager your records. Using MYSQL's built in protections, Employee Tracker also protects you from mistakes like accidentally deleting an entire department full of employees. Employee Tracker uses figlet and chalk for a beautiful terminal experience.
